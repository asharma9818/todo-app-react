start with a funtion in App.js, we return a div with a component Todolist
now we need a TodoForm first, for that we use function and return a form with input and button
Now a form can be submitted so we use onsubmit method in the form tag and pass a function handlesubmit which we will create.
for input box we have a text input to handle and be displayed
so we have to get a value=input 
also we need to handlechange using onchange method 

now we have to initialize the state to use the state.
for this we use usestate for input and set the initial state to empty string
because we need a blank input box on render

we create handleChange function to which we pass a synthetic event e
we have to use e.preventDefault() to prevent the default behavior
or any undesired behavior of the browser.
we set the input using the setInput state to e.target.value

now we need an id and text to be generated onsubmit the form
so we do props.onSubmit and generate id using math and text we use the input from usestate

we also need to clear the input box after submit so we setInput state to empty string at the end of the function

now we jump to create TodoList
we again use a function component 
and return a div with h1 and TodoForm component
here we dont have any view other than h1 as we have to just pass the list as props to the TodoForm component
now TodoForm component can take onsubmit props to be shared with TodoForm component

here again we usestate for todos & newtodos
we create an addTodo function to which we pass todo
